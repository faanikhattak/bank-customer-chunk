This project is a web application designed for predicting bank customer churn using a pre-trained machine learning model. Built with Streamlit, the app collects various customer inputs, such as credit score, gender, age, balance, and membership status. It encodes categorical variables and processes the input data to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank. The application displays the churn probability and provides feedback on whether the customer is likely to churn based on the modelâ€™s prediction. This tool helps banks proactively manage customer relationships and improve retention strategies by identifying high-risk customers.
